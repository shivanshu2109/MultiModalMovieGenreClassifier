# MultiModalMovieGenreClassifier
=======
Dataset
You can download the dataset from various websites like, Hugging Face, Kaggle, Imdb, Omdb, Tmdb
You can use them to download both, the posters as well as movie summaries

Training
For training posters, we used ConvNeXt-Tiny, for plot summaries we used DistiiBERT and then we fused both of them together

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open this folder in IDE, run app.py, ctrl + click on the local host, and then the website will start working.

you can try the poster images and plot summaries in that itself.


If you want to train, you can directly, use .py files for training, but use multimodal_csv_pipeline.py before running train_fusion.py"# Multi-Modal-Movie-Genre-Classification"
